This is a packing defect script for membranes or lipid droplets. In the 'scripts' folder, we have 2 scripts: run_defect.py calculates the defects of the system, incuding those below the protein. On the other hand, run_radius.py modifies the output to then only take into account defects ignoring a given radius around the protein.
